# Tractive-System-Active-Light
Tractive System Active Light (TSAL) displays the state of the tractive system as ACTIVE or
INACTIVE. The circuitry uses a potential divider method to convert the TS voltage to a low voltage of
minimum of 12V at 60V DC on the high voltage side. This 12V goes through a comparator circuit
which ensures that the corresponding TS voltage is greater than 60V DC. A relay is used to switch
between the green LED and 555 Timer Circuit which flashes the red LED when TS is active.
